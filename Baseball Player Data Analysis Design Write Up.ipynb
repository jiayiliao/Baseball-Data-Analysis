    " \n",
    " - Majority of the players are right handed at 64% with left handed players being only 27%. Players who can hit both are 9%. Comparing no. of players to total home run, interesting to see the 27% of left handed players made 34% of the total home run, higher than the other groups.\n",
    " \n",
    " - To look at distribution, box plots were used in dashboard 1 and median batting among all groups  are very close. Looking at distribution in home run, left handed player performance has a wider range and the average is higher. Right handed player's batting average has a wider range than the other groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "- By looking at handedness breakdown, left handed and right handed player have similar trends, where the player who use both hands have more extreme values due to smaller no. of player.\n"
